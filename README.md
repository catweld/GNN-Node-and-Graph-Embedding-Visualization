In progress: this repository visualizes popular graph neural network and graph datasets through dimensionality reduction of node and graph embeddings. Models used include GCN, GraphSage, SplineCNN, GAT, and GIN. Datasets used include MUTAG, CORA, CiteSeer, Protein-Protein Interaction, and MNIST. Examples shown using Pytorch Geometric and DGL.
